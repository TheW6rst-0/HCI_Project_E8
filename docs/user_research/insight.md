# User Research
**Project**: Independent Musician Gig Platform

## Research Objective
To understand the struggles, behaviors, and needs of independent musicians in securing performance opportunities and to validate whether a structured gig-booking system would provide value.

## Key Findings [See survey_analysis for more detailed findings](./surveys/analysis.md)
### Gig Booking is Unstructured & Inefficient
Musicians are wasting time and effort on a disorganized, unpredictable booking process. A direct, structured connection with organizers would significantly improve their ability to secure gigs.

### Cancellations & Unclear Expectations Are a Major Issue
Musicians need booking reliability and clearer expectations (payment, scheduling, cancellation policies) to reduce uncertainty and last-minute changes.

### Social Media is the Primary Promotion Tool, But Not the Best for Gigs
Social media is not an effective gig-finding tool—it helps build an audience, but doesn’t guarantee job opportunities. Musicians need a platform that actively connects them to venues and organizers, not just fans.

### Networking & Personal Connections Play a Huge Role in Getting Booked
The industry is heavily relationship-based, making it hard for new musicians to find opportunities. A system that allows artists to showcase their experience and be discovered without needing prior connections would level the playing field.

### Musicians Want a Professionalized Booking Experience
Musicians are looking for a more professional way to get gigs, showcase their experience, and connect with the right people. They don’t just need exposure—they need structured, real opportunities.

## Unanswered Questions & Areas for Further Research
- What are event organizers’ biggest concerns when booking musicians?
- What role do genre, experience level, and location play in gig opportunities?
- What incentives would make organizers use a musician discovery platform?

## Next Steps
- Conduct interviews with event organizers to understand their perspective.
- Begin refining problem statements and potential solution concepts.

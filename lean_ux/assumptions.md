# Assumptions

## Iteration 1

### User Assumptions
- Independent musicians struggle to find gigs and often don’t get responses from venues.
- Many musicians lack professional industry connections and rely on social media or word-of-mouth for opportunities.
- Musicians want a structured way to showcase their work beyond just social media profiles.
- Event organizers have difficulty finding reliable musicians and waste time filtering through unqualified applicants.
- Both musicians and organizers value professionalism and would benefit from a rating system for reliability and performance.

### Problem Assumptions
- Gig booking is inefficient: Musicians spend weeks reaching out to venues with little success.
- Communication is inconsistent: Organizers frequently cancel gigs, and musicians don’t always respond professionally.
- Lack of transparency: Musicians don’t always know what a venue is looking for, and venues don’t always know what to expect from a musician.
- Payment negotiation is a struggle: Musicians feel underpaid, while organizers want predictable pricing and clear expectations.
- Promotion efforts don’t always lead to gigs: Musicians invest in social media marketing but still struggle to turn engagement into paid opportunities.

### Market Assumptions
- There is no existing platform that fully solves this problem—most musicians rely on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, which aren’t built for gig booking.
- Platforms like Vampr or Jammcard exist, but they don’t focus on gig discovery and direct booking for independent musicians.
- Both musicians and organizers would use a platform that simplifies the hiring process and ensures reliability.

### Behaviour Assumptions
- Musicians will actively create profiles if they believe it will help them get gigs.
- Event organizers will browse and book artists if the platform makes it easier than their current method.
- If a musician gets booked through the platform once, they will continue using it.
- If organizers have a smooth experience, they will return for future bookings.
- Musicians will invite others if they see success, helping the platform grow organically.

# Experiment: User Surveys

### Goal
Gather numerical data and validate if musicians struggle with gig booking and discovery.

### Experiment Setup
- Conduct 5 - 10 minute survey to 10 independant musicians.
- Look for common pain points, behaviours, and workarounds.

### Results
The Key Problems Musicians Face:
- Getting booked is unreliable, inefficient, and slow.
- Most venues don’t respond, and many cancel gigs last minute.
- Social media promotion doesn’t always convert into work.
- There’s no centralized system to connect musicians with venues.

### Conclusion
The numbers prove the demand, and the open-ended responses confirm the frustrations musicians have with the current system.

# Experiment: User Surveys

### Hypothesis to Test
Independent musicians struggle to find and secure gigs because existing methods—such as social media, word-of-mouth, and direct outreach—are inefficient, unreliable, and lack transparency.

### Goal
Gather numerical data and validate if musicians struggle with gig booking and discovery.

### Experiment Setup
- Conduct a 20 question survey to 10 independant musicians. [View survey_form](../../docs/user_research/surveys/survey_form.md)
- Look for common pain points, behaviours, and workarounds.

### Results
The Key Problems Musicians Face:
- Getting booked is unreliable, inefficient, and slow.
- Most venues don’t respond, and many cancel gigs last minute.
- Social media promotion doesn’t always convert into work.
- There’s no centralized system to connect musicians with venues.

### Conclusion
The hypothesis is validated. User data will be used to build personas and further our user reasearch.

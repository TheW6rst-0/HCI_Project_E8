# HCI_Project_E8 - Name TBD (Indie Musician Platform)

## Project Overview  
We're looking to bridge the gap between **independent musicians** and **event organizers** by providing a **structured, reliable** way to book live performances. Unlike traditional music platforms that focus solely on song distribution, we wish to give rising musicians a way to **find gigs, showcase their talent, and connect directly with potential employers** without relying on agencies or inefficient social media outreach.  

## Why This Project?  
Currently, musicians who want to perform live must:  
- Use **social media** (inefficient & unreliable)  
- Rely on **word-of-mouth** (limited reach)  
- Work with **agencies** (costly & restrictive)  

Our research shows that **finding gigs is one of the biggest challenges** for independent musicians in Latin America. We look to provide:  
- A **platform tailored for live performance opportunities**  
- **Direct communication** between musicians and event organizers  
- **Transparent booking & payment expectations**  

## Target Audience  
- **Independent musicians** looking for live performance opportunities  
- **Young to mid-career artists** who want to make music their primary income  
- **Event organizers, bar owners, and festival coordinators** seeking reliable talent  

## Market Opportunity  
There are **no widely adopted platforms in Latin America** dedicated to booking live performances for independent artists. The closest competitor, **Musiqua (Spain)**, offers similar services but lacks a strong presence in this region.  

## Research & Methodology  
To ensure our platform meets real user needs, we conducted:  
- **Surveys & User Interviews** – Validating musician and organizer pain points  
- **Competitive Analysis** – Studying similar platforms (Musiqua, Vampr, Jammcard)  

## Development Plan  
1. **User Research & Validation** (Completed)  
2. **Concept Design & Mockups** (Next Step)  
3. **Prototyping & Usability Testing** (TBD)  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Figma** – Wireframing & UI/UX Design  
- **Jira** - Project Planning and Organization
